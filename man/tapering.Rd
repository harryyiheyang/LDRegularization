\title{Tapering Regularization for LD Matrix (with configurable k_gap)}
\usage{
tapering(A, k_vec = seq(2, 10), k_gap = 2, eigenmin = 0.01, print = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A symmetric matrix (e.g., LD matrix).}

\item{k_vec}{A vector of candidate bandwidths (default: 2:10).}

\item{k_gap}{Taper reach multiplier (>= 1). k_gap = 2 means taper to 0 by 2k; k_gap = 3 means by 3k. Default: 2.}

\item{eigenmin}{Minimum eigenvalue threshold (default: 0.01).}

\item{print}{Logical; if TRUE, prints chosen k and min eigenvalue.}
}
\value{
The regularized matrix after tapering.
}
\description{
Apply tapering regularization to a symmetric matrix.
For a given bandwidth k, entries with |i - j| <= k are kept as 1,
entries with k < |i - j| <= k_gap * k are linearly tapered to 0,
and entries with |i - j| > k_gap * k are set to 0.
The function searches over k_vec and returns the first matrix whose
minimum eigenvalue is at least eigenmin (else it returns the last one).
