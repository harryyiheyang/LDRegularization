\title{poet_linear_shrinkage: Function to perform covariance matrix shrinkage using the POET method}
\usage{
poet_linear_shrinkage(
  S,
  n,
  cutoff_method = "D.ratio",
  k_min = 5,
  k_max = min(15, round(nrow(S)/2)),
  lam_vec = seq(0.025, 0.25, by = 0.025),
  eigenmin = 0.001
)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{A symmetric matrix (p√óp). It can be a covariance matrix or a
correlation matrix.}

\item{n}{The sample size that produced `S`.}

\item{cutoff_method}{Character string specifying how to choose the number of
factors `m`. One of `"D.ratio"` or `"ratio"` (default: `"D.ratio"`).}

\item{k_min, k_max}{Integers giving the search range for the number of
factors `m`. Defaults are `k_min = 5` and
`k_max = min(15, floor(nrow(S) / 2))`.}

\item{lam_vec}{A vector of candidate shrinkage parameters. Default is `seq(0.025, 0.25, by = 0.025)`.}

\item{eigenmin}{The threshold for the minimum eigenvalues used in determining the optimal shrinkage parameter. Default is `1e-3`.}
}
\value{
A covariance matrix that has been shrunk using the POET method.
}
\description{
This function performs shrinkage of the covariance matrix using the POET (Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding) method, with an automatic selection of the number of latent factors and the optimal shrinkage parameter.
